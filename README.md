# Hasting Landing page

The project was build in React without using the create-react-app.

### How to Run :

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm start` in the root directory

### Design :

1. Layout created by following BEM approach
2. Used scss to implement basic layout

### Challenges :

1. Cannot get exact spacing values from preview file.
2. Not all images were present in the folder.
3. Had to type up texts from scratch. Used Lorem ipsum text to save time.

### Things to improve if I had more time :

1. Started the project in a TDD approach or implemented tests using Jest after the main functionalities
2. Made all data to come from a data.js file (as did for footer component and tables) to mock a cms
3. Added helmet for SEO
4. Declared Environment variables instead of hardcoding the config data
5. Rearranged imports in alphabetical order
6. Used gatsby/nextjs to improve page speed, better seo and image optimization
